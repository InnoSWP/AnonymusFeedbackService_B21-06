# Anonymous Feedback Service

## Description

This project represents an app where people can collect feedback. In this app teacher (or anyone who wants) can create a session related to their class to collect feedback from students. The feedback can be sent right during the class if, for example, someone wants to notify teacher with some problems. Or right after class if they want to rate a lesson and send a useful feedback for teacher to work on.

The main idea of this app is that student can send feedback and rate classes anonymously.
So if student is having any troubles pointing some problems to teacher they can send feedback anonymously and even get a response if it is needed.


## How to use
Firstly, user needs to create an account or sign in. Then you go to dashboard and create a new session. There you see a button, which generates a link and copies it to the clipboard automatically. After that you share the link in the group chat, so the students can open a feedback form via this link. Students write their messages, provide their ratings of the class. Teacher can see the feedbacks on his dashboard, answer the questions in case there are, improve something reading feedbacks after the class.
